## 2. View Toilet Details

**Scenario:**

- The user clicks on a toilet pin.
- A toilet card appears showing details: name, description, image, like/dislike buttons, and a star rating.
- On desktop, the card appears on the left side above the map. On mobile, the card appears in the center of the screen above the map.

**Implementation Details:**

- Star rating is calculated as the average of likes and dislikes (out of 5 stars).
- Card should be visually prominent and hover above the map, not replace it.
- Layout must be responsive (left side for desktop, centered for mobile).
