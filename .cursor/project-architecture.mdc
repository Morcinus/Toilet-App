# Project Architecture Overview

- Project repository is on GitHub
- Project will be hosted via Netlify
- Each user action such as creating a toilet, adding an image or liking a toilet should be created as a commit to the repository
- Project doesnt have any user authentication. The users can create and view any content.

## Technologies

- Project should be programmed using:
  - React
  - shadcn/ui
  - Tailwind
  - Hugo - for managing content
  - Google Maps (preferably - if it would be too complicated, you can use other maps)
- Optionally you can use DecapCMS if it would be helpful with the user actions such as creating the new toilet etc.
