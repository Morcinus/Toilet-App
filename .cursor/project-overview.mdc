# Prague Toilet App

## Project Overview

The Prague Toilet App is a playful web app designed as a fun inside joke for a birthday gift. The app allows users to explore, rate, and add toilets in Prague on an interactive map. Each toilet has a card with details, including name, description, image, and a star rating based on likes and dislikes. Users can add new toilets by placing a pin on the map and filling in a simple form. The app is meant to be lighthearted, humorous, and easy to use, with a responsive layout for both desktop and mobile.
